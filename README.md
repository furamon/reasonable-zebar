# reasonable-vertical

Minimalistic vertical bar, designed for use on a ultra wide monitor. Does the job, stays out of your face.

* Enjoy a vertical bar on Windows like its the good old days.
* You have to manually set the height of the bar in `zpack.json` if you have anything other than a 1440p tall monitor *(because i'm a scrub who doesnt know how to make it dynamic)*.
